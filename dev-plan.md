# Physics Adventure - Development Plan

## Game Overview
A 3D web game built with ThreeJS featuring procedurally generated terrain and dynamic physics interactions.

## Core Game Mechanics
- Procedurally generated terrain with realistic height variation
- Physics-based movement and interactions
- Dynamic lighting and shadows
- Different ecosystems appear as player progresses (grassland, forest, desert, snow)
- Terrain features include hills, cliffs, water bodies, stones, animals, plants
- Objects and animals increase in size as player progresses north

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Prototype
1. **Physics Engine Integration**
   - Integrate Ammo.js or Cannon.js for reliable physics
   - Create custom physics for movement and interactions
   - Implement terrain collision detection

2. **Basic Movement & Controls**
   - WASD/Arrow keys for movement
   - Forward/Backward controls for acceleration/deceleration
   - Left/Right for rotation
   - Camera follows player with elastic delay

3. **Core Elements**
   - Simple terrain generation with hills
   - Basic player model
   - Create camera system with follow behavior

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay
1. **Terrain System**
   - Procedural terrain generation
   - Different ecosystem types
   - Dynamic terrain features
   - Resource collection system

2. **Visual Effects**
   - Dynamic lighting and shadows
   - Particle effects
   - Weather system
   - Day/night cycle

3. **Game Progression**
   - Level system
   - Achievement system
   - Resource management
   - Upgrade system

### Phase 3: Polish
1. **Visual Polish**
   - High-quality models and textures
   - Animation system
   - Visual effects
   - UI/UX improvements

2. **Audio**
   - Background music
   - Sound effects
   - Ambient sounds
   - Dynamic audio system

3. **Performance**
   - Optimization
   - LOD system
   - Asset streaming
   - Memory management

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- Ammo.js for physics simulation
- Vite for development and building

### Development Tools
- Git for version control
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest for testing
- Webpack for bundling

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS on modern browsers
- < 500MB memory usage
- < 2s initial load time
- Smooth terrain generation

## Future Enhancements
1. Multiplayer support
2. VR/AR integration
3. Mobile optimization
4. Mod support
5. Custom level editor
