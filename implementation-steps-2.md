# Dung Beetle Game - Implementation Steps

This document outlines a sequential approach to implementing the dung beetle game, broken down into manageable steps.

## Phase 1: Base Environment and Core Mechanics

### Step 1: Three.js Setup
- Set up basic Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- Implement basic lighting (ambient and directional)
- Create a simple flat plane for initial testing

### Step 2: Physics Engine Integration
- Integrate Ammo.js (or Cannon.js)
- Set up physics world with gravity
- Create physics debug helpers

### Step 3: Basic Ball Implementation
- Create simple spherical mesh for the dung ball
- Add physics body with rolling physics
- Test basic ball movement (apply forces and observe)

### Step 4: Basic Beetle Implementation
- Create simple box mesh for the beetle
- Add physics body that stays grounded
- Implement basic movement controls (WASD/arrow keys)

### Step 5: Ball-Beetle Connection
- Create constraint between beetle and ball
- Implement force application from beetle to ball
- Test pushing mechanics

## Phase 2: Core Gameplay Elements

### Step 6: Terrain Generation Basics
- Implement heightmap-based terrain
- Create chunked terrain system
- Test beetle and ball movement on uneven terrain

### Step 7: Camera System
- Implement third-person following camera
- Add smooth following with elastic delay
- Implement zoom based on ball size

### Step 8: Ball Growth Mechanics
- Create collectible dung resources
- Implement collision detection for resources
- Add ball growth functionality
- Update physics properties when ball grows

### Step 9: Obstacle Implementation
- Create basic obstacle types (rocks, water, etc.)
- Implement collision detection for obstacles
- Add ball damage mechanics
- Create broken pieces when ball is damaged

### Step 10: Beetle Upgrade System
- Implement stats system for beetle
- Create upgrade mechanism (trade ball size for better stats)
- Update beetle appearance based on upgrades

## Phase 3: World Building

### Step 11: Enhanced Terrain Generation
- Implement more varied terrain features (hills, cliffs, etc.)
- Add different terrain types with unique physics properties
- Create terrain section generation as player moves

### Step 12: Ecosystem Implementation
- Define different ecosystem types
- Implement ecosystem transitions based on north distance
- Create ecosystem-specific objects and terrain characteristics

### Step 13: Object Placement
- Implement procedural object placement system
- Add trees, rocks, plants with appropriate density
- Create animal entities with simple behaviors

### Step 14: Visual Polish - Environment
- Enhance terrain textures and materials
- Add environment effects (grass, clouds, etc.)
- Implement basic weather effects if time permits

## Phase 4: UI and Feedback

### Step 15: UI Implementation
- Create stats display (ball size, distance, etc.)
- Add beetle cam view
- Implement pause/settings menu

### Step 16: Achievement System
- Create achievement triggers
- Implement milestone celebrations
- Add visual feedback for achievements

### Step 17: Audio Implementation
- Add background music based on ecosystem
- Implement sound effects for ball, beetle, collisions
- Create audio manager with toggle options

### Step 18: Visual Polish - Gameplay
- Add particle effects for collisions and growth
- Implement visual feedback for ball damage
- Create decomposition effects for broken pieces

## Phase 5: Optimization and Final Polish

### Step 19: Performance Optimization
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) system
- Optimize object rendering (instancing for repeated objects)
- Implement physics optimization (sleep distant objects)

### Step 20: Mobile Support
- Create alternative touch controls
- Implement responsive UI
- Optimize performance for mobile devices

### Step 21: Testing and Balancing
- Test gameplay on different devices and browsers
- Balance difficulty progression
- Adjust physics parameters for best gameplay feel

### Step 22: Final Polish
- Add loading screen
- Create introduction sequence
- Implement save/load functionality
- Final bug fixes and optimizations

## Development Approach

For each step:

1. **Create Minimal Implementation**:
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Use simple placeholders for visuals
   - Verify the mechanic works as expected

2. **Test and Iterate**:
   - Test the feature thoroughly
   - Identify issues or improvements
   - Make adjustments as needed

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrate with existing systems
   - Ensure compatibility
   - Resolve any conflicts

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document the implementation
   - Note any design decisions or challenges
   - Update project documentation

## Timeline Estimation

| Phase | Estimated Time |
|-------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 weeks |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 weeks |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks |
| Phase 4 | 1-2 weeks |
| Phase 5 | 1-2 weeks |
| **Total** | **7-12 weeks** |

This timeline assumes a single developer working part-time on the project. Adjust based on available resources and experience level.

## Critical Path

The following elements are critical to the core gameplay experience and should be prioritized:

1. Ball physics and beetle control
2. Ball growth and damage mechanics
3. Basic terrain generation
4. Camera system

Everything else can be considered enhancement and polish that can be added incrementally once the core gameplay loop is functioning.
